# employee-data.
This C++ program  creates instances of this class to represent three different types of employees: a manager, a warehouse worker, and an office worker. The program then populates vectors with these employee objects, presumably representing different departments or roles within an organization.

The program provides a user interface that allows the user to perform several actions, including:

Entering information for a new employee.
Viewing the information of an existing employee.
Removing an employee from the employee list.
Editing an employee's information.
Exiting the program.
